# Decision/Considerations for the algorithm
<B>Date: 18 Apr 2024

## Pseudocode for algorithm:
* Initialise random worms
* For each iteration; For each worm:
    * Recalculate closest distance of worm (other worms may have moved)
    * Recalculate cost function for worm
    * Mutate worm through random walk
    * Find closest distance for the new worm (excluding old worm)
    * Sample image underneath new worm
    * Calculate cost function for mutated worm
    * If new cost function lower, then replace worm with mutated version    
    * Else, keep old worm
* May be worth storing the camouflage and size costs of the worm to make global cost function faster
* Calculate all distances and global cost function
* Save image every X number of steps

* Stop at some point
* Save image of results

## 1. Worm color
* for variation in intensity, or mean intensity
* getting the camo color of the worm
* Using plt.path or using circles on intermediate points

## 2. Cost function
### Internal knowledge
#### Factors to include:
* level of camouflage: (minimise) difference between worm colour and image
* overlap between worms: (maximise) distance between worms - 1/distance
* size of the worm: (drive) bigger worms which are (penalised) for camouflage
### Group knowledge
* wormâ€™s position relative to other worms
### Environemnt knowledge
* intensity of the image around the worm
* ? density/spread of worms within a certain radius<br>
<I> May apply some External/Internal energy functions </I>

### Global cost function
* Cost of a worm + Group knowledge + Environment knowledge

## 3. Mutation
* mutate blocks/one at a time
* random mutation

## 4. Stopping criteria
* number of iterations
* ^ may change later

## 5. Distance between worms
* account for radius/size? i.e smaller worms can be closer

## Experimenation
* Save all images (and data) from experiments
* Save data at the end/intermediately to track progress
