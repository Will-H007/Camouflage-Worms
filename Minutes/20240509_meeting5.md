# Project progress, and task allocation
<B>Date: 9 May 2024

## In progress
* report
* presentation

## 1. Report 
* restructure sections
* cut word count 
### 1. Quantitative Graphs (DONE)
* Add to report (Nicolas)
    * MSE between new vs old: mean coverage of worms
    * number of tiny worms <20px
### 2. Qualitative Reports
* Finish and add tables to Appendix (Ann) - put comments next to trials
* Add metrics to tables to Evaluation (Nicolas) 
#### 3. Algorithm
* lacking - cross-over: mutating dimension by dimension and retaining some of the parent features
#### 4. Introduction
* add inital hypotheses
* approach to cost function
* add thinking for length and width
* move first section of methodology
#### 5. Methodology
* add implementation - add pseudocode to refer in appendices
* mention the "progress"
#### 6. Results
* how did it work
* unexpected/unexpected behaviour
#### 7. Conclusions
* limitations of the beizer curve to fit curves - bends to endpoint
* optimised metrics - did not nessasarily : bigger worms but not useful
* Round 1 was most chaotic but had ?ideal? results

## 2. Presentation
* expain the idea
* ?change pseudo-code to flowcharts (Sophie)
### Allocation
* Introduction - Henry
* Algorithm and other costs - Sophie [slides 3-10]
* Colour cost, general experimentation - Wai [slides 9-11]
* Results and evaluation - Nicolas
* General reflections and conclusion - Ann


## 3. Experimentation details
* 1st round
    * size : length * width
    * worms fit the most obvious contours
* 2nd round
    * length and width: independence between the dimensions (only having the size)
    * halved colour cost
    * increased x,y movement
    * size: the number of pixels that the worm masks
    * length = length * std_end-points
    * width = width * std_middle-points
    * * tried to incentivice smaller worms to grow - failed
* 3rd round
    * inverse distance, size(reduced tiny worms) cost
    * halving the worm mask - default masking twice; makes them smaller
    * distance from the center 
* naming
    * H - half worm mask
    * I - inversed size
    * C - center point - inversed center points distance: penalise worms that a closer (DID NOT WORK)
