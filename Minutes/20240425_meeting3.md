# Decision/Considerations for the algorithm
<B>Date: 25 Apr 2024

## In progress
* adding the colour cost function
* report

## 1. Cost function
### Internal knowledge
#### Factors to include:
* level of camouflage: worm colour vs mean of the background colour
* size of the worm: size vs variation of background colour
* bending of the worm: bend vs contour
### To experiment
* wormâ€™s position relative to other worms
* vary weights for cost

## 2. Assessment of solution
* a quantitative way to measure the effectiveness of the solution
